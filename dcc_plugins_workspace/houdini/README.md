* The zip file's contents may be extracted directly into your houdini's home dir
  (smth like `~/houdini20.0` or `C:\Users\user\Documents\houdini20.0`)

* Alternatively the zip file's content may go somewhere separate, but then 
  you need to ensure to add the path to that location to `HOUDINI_PATH`  
  One way you can do it is through `houdini.env` file  
  I will not give examples here because it highly depends on what else is
  there in your `houdini.env` file.  
  The point is just be sure that path to this directory is in the list, and that
  there is exactly one `&` in the very end on the `HOUDINI_PATH` value
