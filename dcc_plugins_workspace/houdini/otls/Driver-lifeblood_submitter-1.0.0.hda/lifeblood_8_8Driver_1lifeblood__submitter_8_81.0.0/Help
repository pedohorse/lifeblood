= Lifeblood Task Creator =

"""Create a Lifeblood task"""

This node allows for generic Lifeblood task creation.
Arbitrary task attributes may be set, arbitrary environment resolvers used

Generally this node should be wrapped into more artist-friendly nodes that specialize this general behaviour,
but still this node comes with a couple of presets to be used in conjuncture with lifeblood's stock presets, and are
a convenient starting point.

@parameters

== Scheduler Connection Related Parameters ==

create task:
    #id: submit

    create a lifeblood task given all parameters specified below

ip:
    #id: sch_ip

    ip address and port of the scheduler, use Listen To Scheduler's Broadcast button to fill it automatically

Listen To Scheduler's Broadcast to get ip and port:
    #id: broadcast_listen

    for a given timeout listen to scheduler's broadcasts on the network to get ip and port of the scheduler

node name:
    #id: node_name

    Task will be created on a certain node in Lifeblood's node graph. Here you set that name of that node.

    NOTE:
        In Lifeblood name doesn't have to be unique, so make sure to create a unique name for your input nodes in Lifeblood graph

task name:
    #id: task_name

    Name of the task to be created. By default the new task will be added to the group with the same name

priority:
    #id: priority

    This priority will be set to the newly created task group

global scratch location:
    #id: netscratchpath

    This is the root folder that must be accessible by ALL workers (network shared folder)

    Some Lifeblood nodes are set by default to use this location to temporary store task's files. For example - ifd files of the render.
    IFD files will be created there by one node and later rendered by another.

    If you are only using a single machine - this can be set to any local path (temp dir by default)

    If you have several machines that run workers in your home network - this should be some path that is accessible on every machine.
    * in case of windows this can be a mounted network share, like `Z:\shared\lifeblood_scratch\`
    * in case of linux this can be, well, anything, depending on your network setup...

    Assuming that you have already set up network (otherwise workers from other machines won't be able to access hip files, caches,
    textures, assets etc) - it shouldn't be a problem to find a shared scratch location.

    TIP:
        you may save certain scratch location as permanent defaults for your houdini not to write it in every time.
