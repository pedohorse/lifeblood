# Houdini plugin for lifeblood

This directory is expected to be added to `HOUDINI_PATH` variable

* one way you can do it is through `houdini.env` file  
  I will not give examples here because it highly depends on what else is
  there in your `houdini.env` file.  
  The point is just be sure that path to this directory is in the list, and that
  there is exactly one `&` in the very end on the `HOUDINI_PATH` value
