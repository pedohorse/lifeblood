#### Alpha version!
Lifeblood is in prototyping stage. Though announced features SHOULD work,
they can change at any moment

## Lifeblood
is a task/job management software package

In terms of CG industry it's a mini render farm manager

it consists of **scheduler**, **workers** and **viewers**

a scheduler manages multiple workers, giving them tasks to complete.  
GUI tool is used to check on the state of scheduler and tasks and modify task
processing graph.

This system overview should be very familiar to anyone who saw at least one renderfarm.

### Features:
- instantly and easily deployable
- easy scaling in mind
- dynamic worker resources management
- aim for smaller farms or even individual setups
  
### TBD:
- easy cloud deployment
- be integrateable (to some extent) with existing farm managers
